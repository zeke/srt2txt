1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,150
Okay, hi, um as part of our sub 2

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:10,730
compliance audit we have to write a

3
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:14,110
software development like cycle document or an FDLC.

4
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,791
And this is my attempt at getting the ball rolling on that.

5
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:23,737
So I put it in this .github org here as a pull request.

6
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:28,272
.github is a convention used by GitHub where you

7
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:32,047
can store sort of org-wide configuration in there.

8
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,842
So I figured this might be a good place to keep some document about

9
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:40,358
how we use GitHub. Um so in this document I sort

10
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,404
of tried to straddle the line between writing a document that is catering

11
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:50,077
to the requirements and expectations of- the SOC 2

12
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:55,157
process, but also being a document that is hopefully actually

13
00:00:55,158 --> 00:01:00,517
useful for new uh employees and contractors who are

14
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,357
joining the company and want to know how we do software development.

15
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,671
So it covers a lot, covers how we use GitHub,

16
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:11,396
covers our branching methodology,

17
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:13,870
how we should structure projects,

18
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:16,033
how to do documentation,

19
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:20,017
how to standardize on a sort of,

20
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:24,523
scripts for making projects approachable for new developers,

21
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,160
how to do PRs, how to do code review,

22
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:34,746
and basically the whole life cycle,

23
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:37,189
how we do releases, how we do deployment,

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,191
feature flags, etcetera.

25
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:42,405
And so a lot of it is GitHub specific, but there's also some content

26
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:46,110
in here about the various kind of external services that we use.

27
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:50,476
Um, there's a section in here about a depend about and how we use

28
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,518
that, which is Thank you. Uh,

29
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,022
one of the necessary parts of the stock two requirements.

30
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:59,677
Um, so this is ready for a look.

31
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:03,191
There are a few outstanding issues though and I'm not quite sure how to

32
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:07,957
proceed on them. So I took the contents of this current draft and

33
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,541
I'm paste it into Quad and ask if it's looking good enough.

34
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:14,645
Um, and it has some interesting feedback.

35
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,928
So uh,

36
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,773
the first one about access control, it says umm,

37
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,578
you need to describe how you regularly review and update access permissions.

38
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:29,043
So there's a section in the document I have here about our onboarding and

39
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,267
offboarding checklist. Um,

40
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:37,124
but one issue is that we have historically been very generous with permissions

41
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,578
when somebody joins the team even has a contractor.

42
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,563
We of just give them access to the entire organization.

43
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:49,429
Um, so something we might want to consider

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,036
here is do we need to implement a process for determining

45
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:58,420
who needs access to what and being more strict about it.

46
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,583
Um,

47
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:05,159
another thing is change management seems to be a very big

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,872
topic for this. Um,

49
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:13,506
SDLC thing. I haven't really broached the topic of,

50
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:18,074
How we plan and propose and approve the work

51
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:23,332
that we're going. Of course that's you know actively being

52
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:28,007
sort of refined or revised.

53
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,761
By our team, but I don't know how much I want to get into

54
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,044
that in this document. Um.

55
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:37,971
I know we're sort of using a combination of linear and GitHub

56
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:42,567
and notion and varying degrees and it's kind of up in the air.

57
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,821
So, um, I would love feedback on how to address that bit there.

58
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:50,465
Um.

59
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,429
Full durability management. I feel like this is actually pretty well covered.

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,635
I didn't cover back up in recovery because I don't actually really know much

61
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:02,340
about this. Um.

62
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,923
And then there's this section about vendor management and we could go into great

63
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:09,959
detail about all the the third party vendors we work with.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,896
But I don't specifically know what our processes are for assessing

65
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:19,742
them. Whether they're making sure they're up to snap monitoring their

66
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,365
compliance etc.

67
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,428
So those are the outstanding things.

68
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:27,211
Umm.

69
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:31,066
Also happy to move this doc somewhere else if it makes more sense.

70
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,699
Might just make. A sense to put it in motion.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,413
Umm. But since it is good.

72
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:40,499
So get hub specific. I thought this might be a good place to start.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,496
Anyway, uhh looking forward to feedback and I hope this is useful.

74
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,601
Thanks. Bye.
